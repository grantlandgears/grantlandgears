- 👋 Howdy, I’m @grantlandgears
- 👀 I’m interested in Data - raw unadulterated data.  Modeling is amazing, visualizing is beautiful, but swimming around in data is just so darn fun.  No matter how random or obscure a dataset, I always find mystery and intrigue in it.  What stories will it tell!
- 🌱 I’m currently improving my Excel and Gsheets skills.  Next up is improve my viz skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finding work and setting goals.
